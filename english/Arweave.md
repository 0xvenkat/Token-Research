### Overview 
Arweave operates on a blockchain architecture, utilizing a decentralized network of nodes to store and secure data. 
This ensures that information is distributed across the network, making it resistant to censorship and tampering. Arweave is designed to provide permanent and indefinite storage for data. Once stored on the platform, data is intended to remain accessible and unaltered for an extended period, addressing concerns related to data loss or manipulation. Arweave is integrated into the broader Web3 ecosystem, facilitating interoperability with other decentralized technologies and applications. 
This aligns with the vision of creating a more decentralized and user-centric internet.

## Investment Thesis 
#### The Perma-Web
Storing data on the internet lacks permanence, with centralized servers retaining information only as long as monthly subscription fees are maintained. Once these fees cease, the data becomes vulnerable to deletion, contributing to a staggering 95% loss of internet data every two decades. Arweave aims to reshape this scenario by envisioning a lasting internet—a network of applications, information, and data immune to deletion. The platform achieves this by motivating developers to create applications on its blockchain through a profit-sharing model that aligns incentives. Protocols earn fees from Arweave based on their blockchain usage and transactions, fostering a direct correlation between activity and earnings. Arweave has the potential to emerge as the preferred platform for decentralized news outlets, social media platforms, and more.

Presently, data storage predominantly follows a centralized and impermanent model. Users regularly remit monthly fees to cloud storage providers such as AWS and Azure for the privilege of storing their data on these centralized servers. The majority of internet data shares this vulnerability, subject to the control of centralized entities managing the servers. This centralized approach exposes data to the risks of alteration, removal, or censorship. Arweave, however, strives to address these challenges by establishing a decentralized storage network, ensuring 

#### Unique economic Model
Arweave has devised a distinctive economic model that encourages decentralized data storage through node participants, employing a prolonged payment system in AR tokens. 
The economic mechanism employed by Arweave bears resemblance to a traditional economic endowment structure. 
Upon adding a piece of data to the Arweave network, the user initiates an upfront 'principal' payment, from which 'interest' in the form of storage purchasing power accrues. Over time, individuals providing hard drive space receive interest on this one-time upfront payment, allowing them to benefit from their storage contributions. By employing highly conservative estimates for storage pricing, Arweave ensures the enduring sustainability of the network's endowment.

#### The new SaaS (Storage-as-a-service) 
Arweave, recognized as the preferred blockchain for applications prioritizing permanence, can additionally function as an infrastructure layer for enterprises, including other blockchains requiring perpetual storage of crucial metadata. Layer 1 blockchains are not inherently designed for data storage, leading to exorbitant storage costs that impede scalability, as evident in the case of Ethereum. Arweave, positioned as a decentralized data storage layer, offers substantial value in overcoming this challenge. This trend is already manifesting with Solana adopting Arweave as its data storage layer, and Polygon following a similar trajectory.

### Technology 
These are the components that give Arweave its functionality:  

#### Wildfire
It is a mechanism that is responsible for solving the problem of sharing data in a decentralized network.  It operates by establishing an individual ranking system for each node, dictating the speed at which new blocks and transactions are disseminated to peers, contingent on their responsiveness to requests and acceptance of data from others.

#### Proof-of-Access Consensus:
Arweave's consensus mechanism, known as "proof-of-access," requires users to make a small, one-time payment in the platform's native cryptocurrency (AR) to store data. This payment ensures that the data remains accessible over time, creating an incentive for users to contribute to the network's storage capacity. Rather than engaging in a competition to consume excessive electricity, miners strive to generate numerous replications of the data within the system. Additionally, as the blockweave grows in scale, the energy expended in the mining process diminishes.
Blockweave
In contrast to alternative blockchains, Arweave nodes aren't required to download the complete blockchain history to initiate essential network functions. This capability is facilitated through the utilization of block hash lists and active wallet lists. Upon joining the network, new nodes retrieve the current block header along with the comprehensive wallet list and block hash lists.
#### Blockshadows:
To enable a network conducive to extended on-chain data storage, Arweave requires a system that accommodates blocks of unlimited size. Arweave accomplishes this by implementing a system that separates transaction distribution from block distribution within the network. This approach involves circulating only a 'shadow' of the block throughout the system—comprising the instructions essential for reconstructing the block from its individual transactions—rather than transmitting the complete block. Consequently, the details needed to process sizable blocks can be disseminated across the network in just a few kilobytes. 

#### Bundlr
Bundlr is a layer 2 on Arweave protocol that enables users to pay for Arweave storage with non-Arweave tokens. Bundlr internally converts non-AR tokens to AR token.
#### Kyve
Kyve archives historical data from layer 1 chains by providing a seamless connection between the Arweave blockchain and other blockchains.
#### Redstone
A Defi oracle that stores data on Arweave blockchain

### Sector Outlook 
Currently the Total Addressable Market (TAM) for the current Web2 cloud storage market is around ~$75Bn, projected to grow to at a CAGR over 24% to $400bn by 2028. Arweave is on the verge to become the go-to service provider for decentralised long term data storage, providing for Web2 as well as Web3 data storage requirements.

The IT, Telecommunications, and Finance sectors constitute approximately 40% of this market. Given the historical significance and importance of the data handled by these sectors, in the coming decade they will contribute a substantial portion of the demand for decentralized and permanent storage.

### AR Token 
The AR token, native to the Arweave platform, serves a crucial role within the ecosystem, offering various use cases:
#### Payment for Storage: 
AR tokens are utilized to pay for storing data on the Arweave network. Users pay a one-time fee in AR tokens to ensure the permanent storage of their data.
#### Incentives for Miners: 
Miners on the Arweave network receive AR tokens as incentives for providing storage space. This encourages the expansion and maintenance of the decentralized storage network.
####  Governance and Voting: 
AR token holders have the opportunity to participate in the governance of the Arweave network. They can propose and vote on protocol upgrades, changes, and other decisions affecting the platform.
#### Access to Decentralized Applications (dApps): 
AR tokens are used to interact with decentralized applications built on the Arweave network. Users may need AR tokens to access specific services or functionalities within these dApps.
#### Economic Incentives for Validators: 
Validators in the Arweave network, responsible for securing and validating transactions, earn AR tokens as a reward for their services, contributing to the overall security and integrity of the network.
#### Storage Purchasing Power: 
Users who pay AR tokens upfront for storing data accrue "interest" in the form of storage purchasing power over time. This economic model encourages long-term contributions to the network.
#### Token Transfers and Exchanges: 
AR tokens can be transferred between users and traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges, providing liquidity and enabling users to exchange value within and outside the Arweave ecosystem.
#### Integration with DeFi Platforms: 
AR tokens can potentially find use in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, allowing users to leverage their assets for various financial activities within the broader blockchain ecosystem.
#### Facilitating Network Upgrades: 
AR tokens play a role in the network's upgrade process, allowing token holders to participate in key decisions regarding the evolution of the Arweave protocol.

### Tokenomics
In terms of AR supply, Arweave adheres to a maximum hard-capped supply of 66 million AR tokens. Of this total, 55 million AR tokens were generated during the inception of the blockweave's genesis block in June 2018. The remaining 11 million AR units are set to be gradually introduced into circulation as block rewards.
During Arweave's pre-sale event in August 2017, the project successfully distributed 10.8% of the initially minted tokens. Subsequently, during the public sale events in May 2018 and June 2018, Arweave allocated 7.1% and 1.1% of AR tokens, respectively.
Furthermore, specific allocations were made for various purposes, with 19.5% of the supply designated for a private sale, 2.9% for project advisors, and 19.1% for ecosystem development. Within the remaining supply, the Arweave team acquired 13% of AR tokens, while 26.5% were reserved for future utilization.

Fresh AR tokens enter circulation through AR mining rewards, a process in which miners contribute by adding new blocks to the AR network and, in turn, receive incentives in the form of AR tokens. 
The necessity of having access to a random recall block to generate a new block serves as motivation for miners to expand their data storage, fostering increased participation in the network. 

### Competitive Landscape 
#### Unique Proposition 
Whether it's Filecoin, Storj, or Sia, all these decentralized storage solutions operate on a contract-based storage model, allowing users to store a specific amount of data for an agreed-upon period. However, Arweave distinguishes itself with a unique offering – permanent storage, enabling users to retain their data indefinitely through a one-time payment.
In contrast, contract-based storage solutions like Filecoin find themselves in direct competition with giants like Amazon Web Services, which can leverage their extensive operations to provide subsidized storage costs. While Filecoin may capture a portion of the Web3 storage market, it faces challenges in undercutting established players such as Amazon.
Arweave's innovative approach to indefinite storage with a single payment sets it apart. Rather than entering the competitive pay-as-you-go storage market, Arweave establishes a new niche – permanent storage. The distinctiveness of Arweave's model becomes apparent when considering its applications, particularly in blockchain storage solutions like Solana storing data on Arweave and collaborations with entities like the Internet Archive for archiving internet data.

#### Low Entry Barrier
Filecoin advises miners to possess 128-156 GB of RAM and a 24 Core CPU to offer storage services on their network, making it a requirement for miners to invest a substantial amount in powerful machines to participate in the Filecoin ecosystem.
In contrast, becoming part of the Arweave network is more accessible. Miners merely require a Linux system with a minimum of 8 GB RAM to initiate the production of new blocks on the Arweave network.
