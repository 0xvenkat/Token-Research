# Overview
Over the past ten years, we have been witnessing a shift towards a world that increasingly prioritizes the virtual realm over the physical. 
Presently, we find ourselves on the cusp of a new phase seeking to further dissolve the boundaries between the virtual and physical domains. 
Whether it's social media, films, virtual reality, augmented reality, or even holographic environments, the ongoing departure from the physical world encompasses various essential elements, with rendering being a crucial aspect. 
Rendering has always played a role, be it in the movies we watch, the cartoons we enjoy, or the intricate scale models crafted by architects. 
As the demand for rendering continues to rise, there is a corresponding need for enhanced quality and speed in rendering processes. 
The Render Network addresses this need by providing rapid and cost-effective rendering solutions, utilizing GPU acceleration and a decentralized approach.

# Investment Thesis
### Shift towards Virtual/Augmented Reality
As NFTs and the metaverse have experienced significant growth in the past year, and the gaming industry has seen colossal expansion over the last decade, it's evident that we are progressing toward a more virtual mode of social interaction. 
People now prefer socializing on their phones or within gaming environments rather than meeting face-to-face. 
This shift extends beyond mere instant messaging or video calls, as games and emerging "metaverses" enable digital social interactions that closely mimic the characteristics of traditional physical engagements. 
Instances like Fortnite hosting in-game concerts and events exemplify this trend. To enable and sustain this trend, efficient and rapid rendering is crucial. 
For this virtual space to scale effectively, rendering costs must also decrease significantly.
As the hype around Metaverses expands, an increasing number of individuals are adopting digital avatars within these virtual realms to emulate or substitute physical gatherings such as concerts, galleries, and weddings in platforms like Sandbox and Decentraland. 
This shift has resulted in a heightened demand for live-streaming and high-quality rendering to meet the computational requirements. 
Looking ahead, the optimistic goal is to enhance the experience by making it more "life-like" through holographic representations. Such rendering necessitates a foundational network capable of simultaneously addressing high-speed demands and low costs, a capability that Render already provides.

### Idle Power
By prioritizing GPUs over CPUs, The Render Network taps into a significantly larger reservoir of computing power. 
GPUs, or graphics cards, are ubiquitous, found in phones, laptops, and even among PoW crypto miners. As we shift towards a PoS ecosystem and witness a global increase in the number of graphics cards, there will be a substantial amount of idle GPU power available for utilization that would otherwise remain unused. 
This not only facilitates the efficient use of resources but also generates economic incentives for GPU holders.


### Slow and Expensive alternatives; Unscalable for Individuals 
The process of rendering is both resource-intensive and costly. To provide context, a decade ago, individual frames would take 6 to 8 hours to render. 
Even in the present day, achieving high-quality rendering remains an expensive endeavor, often necessitating the involvement of a costly visual effects studio to complete the task. 
This proved to be financially unfeasible for individual creators seeking to complete rendering jobs. However, with Octane (and now, thanks to the Render Network), rendering has been scaled by distributing the computational workload across multiple GPUs that simultaneously process the render. 
This approach significantly reduces costs and the overall time required. Creators can now take advantage of the Render Network by submitting a render job and can expect it to be completed rapidly and cost-effectively.

### Octane Render: Core OTOY Software 
OTOY Inc. oversees the operations of the Render Network, and it is a software company renowned for offering Octane, the world's fastest GPU-accelerated renderer. Unlike other renderers that rely on CPU power, OctaneRender optimizes GPU power, resulting in rendering speeds that surpass those of alternative renderers by orders of magnitude. 
The core software is widely adopted for rendering tasks worldwide and has established partnerships with prominent entities such as Disney and HBO. 

### Active Network Participation 
To enable decentralized large-scale rendering, an infrastructure of nodes must be in place to consistently handle and validate render requests, payments, computations, and other related tasks. 
This establishes an opportunity for active participation in the network, with corresponding economic incentives provided in return. 

## Technology 
The Render Token is the primary unit designated for the exchange of rendering and streaming services, as well as for providing proof-of-render work on the OctaneRender Cloud (ORC) network, OTOY's cloud rendering marketplace.
In its ultimate state, the token will empower users to leverage the extensive array of available GPUs within the peer-to-peer network, enabling swift and dependable rendering processes that are tracked by the blockchain.

### Orc Network
#### Users a.k.a Creators 
Orc Network Users, referred to as Creators, will establish accounts on the Orc Network linked to a blockchain (initially Ethereum, with plans to migrate to Solana) through smart contracts and unique wallets. To access rendering services on the network, users must acquire and store RNDR tokens in their accounts.
Upon the submission of a render request, the network will initiate a request for a Render token smart contract to facilitate a transaction between the parties involvedâ€”the entity processing the render/streaming and the requester of rendering services. The cost of the job will be calculated and expressed in Render tokens. Subsequently, the smart contract will transfer funds between accounts upon the completion of the assigned render job.

#### Node Operators 
Node Operators enlist their GPUs in the RNDR network, making them available for "rent" by Creators seeking additional computational power. In return for rendering time, Node Operators receive compensation in the form of RNDR tokens. Currently, to become a node operator and join the network, individuals must complete a form and enter a queue for whitelisting and network inclusion.
The Network Imagine you are an individual requiring a prompt rendering task.
You submit the task to the Render Network. The Network then computes the task cost based on demand and supply factors across the entire network, managing transactions through a smart contract. The user processing the job utilizes the idle GPU to execute the task and submits the completed request back through the network. Upon task reconciliation, the smart contract releases payment in RNDR tokens. 1 RNDR is equivalent to 256 seconds of work at a 256 Octane bench (GPU unit benchmark). The Network acts as a coordinator, managing the demand and supply of GPU compute power (render jobs) and distributing tasks across nodes. Essentially, the network functions as a marketplace.

## RNDR Tokenomics
The DAO of the project has unanimously approved the adoption of a new tokenomics model known as the burn and mint equilibrium model. Under this updated model, users will no longer pay for services rendered in RNDR; instead, they will use USD, and the corresponding value in RNDR will be burnt, systematically reducing the supply of the RNDR token.
When a user makes a payment in USD, and the equivalent RNDR value is burnt, an equal amount of "Render Credits" will be minted and issued to monitor the completed jobs.
Operators running nodes on the Render Network will receive rewards based on their availability to fulfill jobs and the number of jobs they successfully complete during the network's current timeline. 

The RNDR ICO took place from October 6th to October 12th, 2017, with an initial token price of $0.25 USD. During this period, 4,650,922 RNDR tokens were sold, generating $1.16 million for the team.
The remaining RNDR tokens were allocated as follows:
 * 10% for team members and advisors, subject to a six-month lockup period
 * 25% earmarked for future token sales
 * 65% designated for the user development fund
In 2018, RNDR conducted a private sale round, resulting in approximately 3% of the 25% allocated for token sales being sold at the ICO price of $0.25 USD. These tokens were immediately available to buyers without any lockup period.

## Industry Outlook 
Presently, the entire 3D rendering market stands at approximately $2 billion, and projections anticipate a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.2%, bringing the market value to around $8 billion by 2025.
Key drivers for the potential growth of the Visualization and 3D Rendering Software market include high technology adoption and the existence of advanced technological infrastructure, both of which are expected to be prominent trends throughout the forecast period. The escalating demand for video games with enhanced graphics has spurred the utilization of motion capture and visualizations, contributing to the growth of the Visualization and 3D Rendering Software market until 2028.
With the rising need for holographic renders in applications like games and individual creations, there is a prospect for this market to reach a substantial $20 billion by 2025. Existing competitors such as Corona, Lumion, Keyshot, providing CPU rendering, and AWS, Azure, offering cloud rendering, are currently active in the market. 

## Network Mechanics
The protocol imposes a fee ranging from 0.5% to 5% per render request, directing the proceeds to the treasury. RNDR holders have the authority to determine the allocation of treasury assets through governance. 
As the protocol handles an increasing number of render requests, more RNDR is utilized within the network, leading to a growth in value accumulated in the protocol treasury. 

## Key Network Metrics 
. Frame data throughout the year as a whole remained relatively even, as seen below:
* Q1 2023: 2.12 million frames rendered

## Competitve Landscape 
Within the blockchain realm, there are no direct competitors offering rendering services; however, platforms like Arweave, Filecoin, and Livepeer provide alternative forms of decentralized computing power. These platforms share similar protocol economics, establishing extensive node networks incentivized by token rewards, with the native token used to compensate for services rendered by the distributed nodes. Arweave, Livepeer, Helium, and Filecoin serve as the most relevant comparisons to Render, as they generate explicit revenues for their network usage.
Explicit fees refer to the charges users pay in protocol tokens for utilizing network services. For instance, users pay for storage on Filecoin or Arweave, streaming video on Livepeer, and Data credits on Helium.

It's apparent that these infrastructure protocols are currently valued higher than the revenues they generate, but the concentration of users reflects the nascent nature of the space. Anticipating exponential user growth over time as products enhance user experience and establish strong product-market fit, these protocols are expected to provide services akin to Web2 at significantly lower costs. This, in turn, will attract users and generate revenue.
Comparing Render's Network to similar protocols in the Web3 space, it is evident that the protocol is considerably undervalued in relation to its counterparts. This assessment takes into account the consistently high demand for rendering services provided by the Render Network compared to other protocols.
