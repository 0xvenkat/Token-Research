#### Threats
*	Possibility for fraudulent activity: Since Data is not stored on-chain the balances of the users are not published on-chain, but rather sent to several well-known and trusted parties, also known as committee members, handing significant power to these small set of people. Additionally a state update is valid and accepted on-chain only if it is endorsed by the committee members. On the other hand, funds can be lost if the external data becomes unavailable. Users can also be censored if the committee restricts their access to the external data. Hence, there is a notable risk that arises when a certain group of people have centralized power.
*	Hyperinflationary Marketplace: In the past there have been reports which concluded that the trading volumes for specific games, notably top sellers like Gods Unchained and Blocklords, are artificially inflated. These games are created and released by Immutable X and its partners. Immutable X with its Reward System incentivizes traders on their platform. By interacting and trading on the platform users earn reward points. Points are earned non-linearly and increase with trading activity. Once the daily trading volume reaches $10,000, point accumulation ceases. Points are then converted into IMX tokens based on individual point earnings relative to others. Reports have shown the occurrence of wash-trading, where addresses have a consistent pattern where they buy and resell the same assets endlessly to accrue the reward points. 
The metaverse is in its early stages and poses risks for participants. While Immutable X shows promise, it should prioritize substantial projects over high-volume showcases for authentic and enduring industry growth. Preventing manipulation of volumes by savvy individuals is crucial to maintain public trust and uphold the credibility of crypto projects.

#### Transaction Volume
The Daily Average Transaction volume has witnessed a substantial rise over the last few months for IMX as it surged past $25M USD in average volume in November 2023 against $10M and $8M of October and August 2023 respectively.  This gives us a clear picture on how the network is being increasingly utilized in the past couple of months.
#### NVT Ratio
The Network Value to Transaction ratio of IMX as of December 1st  2023 stood at 28.85. The NVT is the ratio of market capitalization divided by transacted volume in the specified window analogous to the PE Ratio. In the crypto world, it is a measure investor’s perception on the token’s value in relation to its utility, specifically in terms of transaction volume. An NVT below 50 is considered being undervalued and signals a bullish trend. Hence, IMX is considered highly undervalued at its current state. 
#### Token Velocity
The IMX Token Velocity as of December 1st, 2023 was an exceptional 1.5, slipping from its peak of 4.5 in March ’23.  Velocity is the ratio of total transaction volume in USD to the token's market cap, essentially the inverse of the NVT ratio. Unlike the NVT ratio, token velocity considers exchange transactions, providing insights into a coin's liquidity and usage rate for investors. The high velocity ratio of IMX reflects the correlation between the high TPS and liquidity of IMX while indicating the high utilization and transactional value derived from the token. 

### Technical analysis 
IMX/USD is forming a very strong bullish trend. Experiencing an uptrend since the beginning of the year, $IMX price reached a peak of $1.60 in March. 
The RSI, serving as a momentum indicator, aids traders in assessing market conditions for asset accumulation or sale. A reading above 50 with an upward trend favors bulls, while a reading below 50 signals the opposite. The weekly RSI, currently rising and above 50, indicates a bullish trend. 
After descending below a resistance trend line, $IMX established a higher low in October, breaking out from the trend line in the subsequent month. In the aftermath, the IMX price has seen ten consecutive bullish weekly candlesticks. Currently trading within the ultimate long-term horizontal resistance zone before the all-time high of $9.50, it achieved a new yearly high of $2.56 on 28th December—its highest price since March 2022. 
The $IMX price action in the daily time frame is also showing bullish signs. A notable surge resulted in a breakout from an ascending parallel channel on December 11, followed by the IMX price confirming the channel as support on December 18. 
IMX is positioned within a confluence of resistance levels at $2.35, combining both a horizontal resistance zone and the 1.61 external Fibonacci retracement level from the previous decline. A breakout and daily closure above $2.35 has the potential to initiate a 50% surge toward the subsequent resistance at $3.50. Conversely, a descent below the channel may result in a 35% decline to the nearest support at $1.50.
