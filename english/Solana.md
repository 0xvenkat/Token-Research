# Investment Thesis 
#### A Layer-1 with L2 Features 
As decentralized applications (dApps) explore Layer 2 solutions for scaling, Solana presents a distinctive value proposition that extends beyond performance. By constructing on Solana as a Layer 2 atop a Layer 1 blockchain, applications can leverage inherent Layer 1 features such as fiat on/off ramps, native stable coins, and seamless integration with the entire Layer 1 ecosystem. Unlike EVM Layer 2s lacking fiat onramps, which necessitate users to initially transfer funds through Ethereum, incurring a cost of approximately $50, onboarding on Solana costs less than 1 cent. Solana is poised to offer a more extensive range of composable functionalities compared to any Layer 2, despite having a smaller native ecosystem.
Solana's interoperability with Ethereum, facilitated by independent cross-chain bridges like Wormhole, is already established, and further cross-chain integrations are in development. Furthermore, the imminent introduction of Ethereum-compatible execution environments on Solana will enhance its portability, aligning it with the versatility of an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based Layer 2.

#### The Multichain future
While Ethereum remains the dominant player in on-chain activities such as NFTs and DeFi, Solana stands out by catering to high-throughput DeFi applications, particularly for institutions seeking permissionless and scalable crypto solutions through on-chain order books. This is a capability that Ethereum cannot replicate effectively due to its slower processing times. In addition to Solana's ongoing efforts in cross-chain interoperability, demonstrated through collaborations with projects like REN and Wormhole, developers now have the opportunity to create smooth and interconnected applications across different blockchains.  

#### Proof-of-History
The primary consensus mechanism employed  is proof of stake; however, Solana introduces an additional layer known as proof of history. 
In distributed networks, a significant challenge arises in reaching a consensus on the timing and sequence of events, as nodes cannot inherently trust timestamps on messages received from other nodes. 
Solana addresses this challenge by establishing a cryptographically secure source of time throughout the network. Proof of History functions as a high-frequency Verifiable Delay Function, necessitating a specific number of sequential steps for evaluation while generating a unique output that is publicly verifiable. This innovation enables nodes to create the next block without the need for extensive coordination with the entire network, as they can rely on the trusted timestamps and message ordering they have received. Consequently, this reduces consensus overhead, allowing for higher transaction throughput on the network. Additionally, technologies such as tower BFT and turbine complement and optimize the proof of history framework.

#### Ultra-High Performance dApps 
There is a significant potential to develop a new category of decentralized applications, made feasible by a high-performance and scalable blockchainl. 
DeFi's predominant use cases have been confined to less time-sensitive transactions where the value proposition justifies users tolerating high fees and slow speeds. 
Lending protocols and Automated Market Makers have prevailed in DeFi, given their ability to accommodate lengthier processing times. However, the emergence of Binance Smart Chain highlights a demand for lower transaction fees despite centralization risks. Use cases requiring high throughput and low fees have struggled to compete with centralized counterparts and have largely gone unexplored on existing blockchains. Solana's scalable processing capacity positions it as an environment where such use cases can thrive. Projects focused on high-frequency trading, central limit order books (CLOB), derivatives, cloud computing, and cloud storage have already found success on Solana, supporting over 1 billion user accounts on a single state machine. Integrating both retail and high-performance trading will enhance the efficiency of interconnected ecosystems.

Solana's unique scalability also extends to mainstream retail use cases like gaming, music streaming, collectibles, and social networks, enabling decentralized implementations that may be challenging on other chains. Looking ahead, major infrastructure, ranging from credit card payments to public equities trading, could be deployed on Solana, potentially surpassing the transactions per second capabilities of both NASDAQ (600K TPS) and Visa (100K TPS). As hardware and bandwidth costs decline (roughly 50% every two years), Solana's performance is expected to improve at a comparable rate, doubling its throughput every two years in line with Moore's Law. Furthermore, with a growing interest from web 2 enterprises and institutions seeking to leverage blockchain, Solana stands uniquely positioned to support millions of users within this evolving landscape.

#### Scalability 
Genuine solutions exist for enhancing blockchain scalability through layer 2 solutions or sharding. However, Solana's inherent layer 1 scalability introduces a level of adaptability that becomes challenging when transaction processing is compartmentalized across different layers or shards. The significance of adaptability particularly in atomic multi-step transactions, has been underscored by the DeFi sector. As transactions evolve in complexity, value, and volume over time, the demand for subsecond finality and high throughput will increase, requirements that sharding or layer 2s cannot adequately support. Solana stands out with its ability to process at scale on a single layer 1, providing transaction finality that aligns with institutional standards.
Solana's technology has been meticulously crafted from the ground up, and deliberate choices were made to structure the blockchain without sharding or L2 technology. Concerns around compatibility, timeline, and end user experience prompt skepticism about the effectiveness of L2. The Solana team argues against sharding, citing security issues stemming from the division of security in sharded systems. Ethereum's heterogeneous L2 scaling introduces fragmentation, presenting challenges such as varying block times and computational throughput across L2s, lengthy withdrawal times necessitating adjustments for market makers, and the need for wallets and developers to rework integrations with each L2.

#### Developer Focused Environment
Solana's high-performance layer 1 blockchain significantly streamlines the developer experience. The constrained throughput of many existing blockchains creates an incentive for developers to minimize on-chain activity to conserve block space and manage transaction costs. This often results in unnecessarily intricate technical architectures. Numerous decentralized applications (dApps) depend on a multitude of off-chain systems, and to achieve scalability, they may resort to building across side chains or layer 2 solutions. This approach introduces substantial development complexities, security vulnerabilities, and constraints on protocol functionality and decentralization. Solana's extensive capacity allows for more on-chain operations than ever before.
Smart contracts on Solana are crafted in Rust, a programming language consistently ranked as one of the most beloved (for four consecutive years on StackOverflow). On GitHub, the Rust community boasts 24,000 users contributing code, surpassing the 3,500 developers contributing Solidity code. While comparing community size may not be entirely equitable (given that 100% of Solidity developers are focused on Ethereum, whereas only a fraction of Rust developers work on Solana), it does underscore the accessibility for new developers entering the space.

### $Sol Token
The native token of the Solana blockchain is called SOL. SOL serves various use cases within the Solana ecosystem, including:
1.	Transaction Fees: SOL is used to pay for transaction fees on the Solana network. Users and developers need SOL to initiate and validate transactions, interact with smart contracts, and participate in the network.
2.	Smart Contract Deployment: SOL is required for deploying smart contracts on the Solana blockchain. Developers must stake SOL to publish and execute their smart contracts.
3.	Staking and Consensus: SOL holders can participate in staking by locking up their tokens to support the network's consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Stakers are rewarded with additional SOL for securing the network.
4.	Governance Participation: SOL holders have the opportunity to participate in the governance of the Solana network. They can propose and vote on protocol upgrades, changes, and other decisions related to the network's development.
5.	Validator Node Collateral: Validators on the Solana network, responsible for confirming transactions and maintaining the network's security, are required to deposit a certain amount of SOL as collateral.
6.	Decentralized Applications (dApps): SOL is often used within decentralized applications (dApps) built on the Solana blockchain. Users may need SOL to access and utilize features within these applications.
7.	Token Swaps and Exchanges: SOL is traded on various cryptocurrency exchanges. Users can buy, sell, and trade SOL tokens on these platforms, facilitating liquidity and price discovery.

Currently, Solana is an inflationary token. However, Solana's inflation rate is based on a pre-determined disinflationary schedule as can be seen below: 
![image](https://github.com/0xvenkat/Token-Research/assets/153609255/a8e66615-4345-45d3-97db-94721674f378)
At commencement the inflation  rate was at 8% and decreases every year (epoch year - approximately 180 epochs) by 15% until it reaches 1.5% (Current inflation is 5.69%).
Solana implements a burning mechanism wherein 50% of every transaction fee is intentionally destroyed, while the remaining 50% is directed to the primary validator responsible for processing that particular transaction. This setup serves as a motivating factor for validators to maximize transaction processing within their designated slots in the leader schedule. This mechanism, coupled with the deflationary inflation schedule, implies that as Solana experiences growth in throughput and activity over time, it will face substantial deflationary forces.

### Key Network metrics 
Over the past 30d, SOL has generated an impressive $1.85m in revenue. Putting it 20th overall and 5th amongst other chains. 50% of each transaction fee is burned, with the remaining going to the validator processing the transaction. 
TVL is hovering around $1.06b. Which is up 5x since the start of 2023 ($210m TVL). While this is an impressive gain, in the last bull run in 2021, SOL peaked at just under $10b TVL, asserting that there plenty of room left to run.
