## Introduction
As the world adopts Defi as a lawful mode of finance, persuading traditional finance traders to migrate into Satoshi’s ethos, their transactions are forced through a contradictory system of centralized private key storage and custodians. 
Up until recently, a digital asset holder would have to manage and securely store the private key  associated with the crypto holdings to generate a digital signature (to move funds) and a public key (to verify the signature). However, if the private key is lost/stolen all the assets are compromised, often with no way of retrieving them. 99% of all large-scale cryptocurrency thefts are linked to unauthorized access to private keys. Until now the only other option to ‘self-custody’ is to avail the services of a digital asset custodian. Centralized custodians can be defined as “one that holds, has any access to, or can stop access to the private keys to a user’s digital assets.” It becomes quite paradoxical to utilize the security of a decentralized network provided by blockchains, through centralized custodians as it naturally creates counterparty and regulatory risks.

Qredo protocol  is a non-custodial decentralized custodian that does not hold users’ keys and therefore cannot stop user-generated transactions. The Qredo protocol is built using the groundbreaking architecture of multi-party computation (MPC) where public keys and digital signatures can be produced in a manner that does not require a private key. MPC is the biggest advancement in public-key cryptography in nearly 50 years, where several parties jointly perform computation while keeping the private inputs secret. Qredo is the first to offer a consensus-driven MPC which is secured without the need for centralized private key storage. In other words, Qredo enables decentralized custody of digital assets by replacing cumbersome and risk-prone private keys with mathematical computations across multiple parties that are just as trustless as blockchain transactions.

## Investment Thesis
### Unique Selling Point
Institutions are getting ready to integrate into decentralized finance. Big hedge funds and corporate treasuries such as MicroStrategy and Tesla hold billions of dollars of BTC in their balance sheets. However, most institutions are wary when entering the ecosystem as decentralized finances are riddled with notorious barriers. First and foremost, as fiduciaries they will be held legally responsible for their clients’ investments. Consequently, institutions must demonstrate that the assets under management are secure and there are controls in place to prevent unauthorized trading and withdrawals. But institutions are unable to justify the enormous counterparty risk posed by the capital requirements of unregulated exchanges along with the risk-fraught private key storage. Another hurdle for large-scale decentralized trading of cryptocurrencies comes in the form of laborious and expensive cross-chain swaps and cross-platform liquidity. Institutions are yearning for a protocol that solves these problems while concurrently being able to comply with the looming regulations from statutory bodies.

Seeing that the deepest pockets of finance are being sidelined, Qredo has paved the way for a barrier-free entry for institutions. 
They have primarily made this possible by providing institutional grade custody of digital assets through their decentralized and secure MPC.
The protocol also enables access to DeFi opportunities and the ability to trade & transfer assets instantly through cross-chain swaps. 
Qredo provides unparalleled governance and reporting features which allows institutions to customize their custody as well as adapt to any future compliance rules brought on by regulators.

### Financial & Partnerships
Qredo closed a $11 million seed funding round in May 2021, and it is no coincidence that Qredo’s early investors are leading institutions such as G1 , Gumi Cryptos, Maven 11, Spartan Group. Qrerdo’s ICO in July ‘21 raised over $18 million in under two hours. 
The private sale that preceded the public offering garnered a strong demand from the biggest names in crypto, raising over $16million from investors such as **0T Fund, Coinbase Ventures, LedgerPrime, AVA Labs, Kingsway Capital Partners,Nexo, Figment**, among others. The true potential of Qredo is unlocked through their strategic partnerships. 
Qredo has made a monumental partnership with **MetaMask Institutional wallet**. Metamask is the world's leading cryptocurrency wallet for decentralized finance with over 10 million monthly active users. Qredo has also partnered with leading builders in DeFi such as **Wintermute, CMS Holdings, and Kronos Research**. Deribit, the world's largest futures and options exchange, is integrating to boost liquidity in Qredo’s growing ecosystem.

$QRDO is a utility and governance token for the Qredo network. The token has a market cap of merely $35million and the daily trading volume hovers around $5 million.The total supply of $qredo is hard capped at 2 billion with the initial supply estimated to be around 110 million. 
Qredo’s ‘use-centric’ tokenomics not only rewards its miners and validators but all its users. Anyone holding  $QRDO in the network will automatically earn a staking yield of 10.1% APY. According to the Qredo token paper, the team’s share is 22% while investors get 34%, with a long vesting schedule. Currently, 48% of $QRDO is held by the top 100 wallets, which also includes some exchanges. The token is traded on multiple exchanges including major ones such as KuCoin and Bitfinex. 
Currently priced at $0.55USD this coin has immense potential to return to its all time high of **$9.77** This would approximately generate a quick and easy **20x return** on investment in the short term, while it aims to create generational wealth for its long-term holders. 

### Vision
Decentralized custody and beyond
Qredo is tackling the challenge of centralized private key storage with a fusion of multi-party computation and blockchain that harks back to Satoshi's original ethos of trust minimization. Offering a new way of managing private keys, and unlocking multiple use cases across the crypto ecosystem.
It is tackling the two most significant problems plaguing the crypto market
1. Poor security and 
2. Fragmented liquidity 
Stemming from a single quirk: the centralized management of private keys. This has made it difficult for institutions to enter the ecosystem, and enabled an extensive catalog of hacks.  
  Solution: **Decentralizing the management of private keys**


### Technology and Infrastructure 
Qredo is a cross-chain layer 2/layer 3 protocol built on a fork of the tendermint blockchain. The project is built on open-source protocols such as Tendermint, Apache Milagro libraries, and Matrix. Tendermint being blockchain-agnostic enables Qredo to act as a fast-finality Layer 2 solution for almost any blockchain, allowing its users to easily transact with multiple assets using a single protocol. 
The layer 2 solution drastically improves scalability while ensuring network participants to perform atomic swaps, track records asset ownership across different layer 1 blockchains. 
Qredo utilizes a method called ‘crystallization’ where real values present in the layer 1 of the blockchain are mapped 1:1 in value on Layer 2 blockchain as a synthetic value. If a user deposits 1BTC, Qredo automatically mints its synthetic counterpart on layer 2, and in this case credits the trader's wallet with 1qBTC. 
Using Qredo’s blockchain explorer one can track exactly where the qBTC links its value on the Layer 1 blockchain. Qredo does not engage in rehypothecation guaranteeing the network is always solvent. In other words, 1qBTC on the second layer will always track to 1BTC on Layer 1. 

As all assets are held in Layer 2 incorporated with a Consensus-Driven Multi-Party Computation (CD-MPC) network allows transactions between users to be authenticated instantaneously with no counterparty, settlement or payment risk, including Layer 1 atomic swaps (BTC for ETH), or crypto-to-fiat transactions. 
Qredo has also introduced a end-to-end encrypted decentralized conversation replication network as Layer 3 to handle everything from machine to machine communications to storing and providing an audit trail for regulated pre-trade communications. The Layer 3 solution, justifiably named ‘Matrix’,  uses the cryptographic identity of users from the Layer 2 blockchain as the foundation to provide end-to-end encryption (privacy), authentication into message stores, message integrity, non-repudiation among various other features.

Qredo’s front end constitutes a webapp that requires signing through a mobile app (PIN plus biometrics). A wallet’s administrator can create organization accounts and authorize users such as traders, managers and other administrators. 
All parties can invite other wallets to join their trusted network permitting them to view outstanding orders, account activity, inventories and whitelisted addresses.

### Market Analysis & Competitors 
Sustaining in the void of digital asset safekeeping is a complex challenge and it is one that has hindered the progress of this industry. 
Approximately $182 billion worth of Assets under Custody (AuC), is under the top three custody providers. 
Digital asset custody providers have reportedly raised $900 million so far. However, Qredo’s competitive landscape is complex as it does not only provide custody solutions. 
They  bundle several other features together, namely a cross-chain protocol, a DeFi platform (lending, asset swaps), and minting synthetic assets (qTokens). This puts Qredo in the intersection of cross-chain protocols and custody providers as seen below.

### Tools & Analytics
The pre-eminent tool available to our disposal is analyzing the total market cap of the cryptocurrency. As it stands the price of a $Qrdo token is $0.55 and when multiplied by its total circulating supply of 611,471,036 QRDO we get the total market cap of the token: $34,345,547. We can now compare it to other protocols that are considered its competitors. 
  THorchain has a market cap of $2,000,700,555. 
  Chainlink has a marketcap of $8,347,504,477. 
  Uniswap has a market cap of $3,705,045,391. 
  Hence, it can be seen that QRDO’s competitive landscape attracts high investments with their marketcap reaching above $1Billion. Consequently, it is highly likely that Qredo’s marketcap will also go beyond the $1B mark. 
  If it does reach the three comma market cap, an investment in $QRDO now will engender close to a 300x on ROI. 

The next tool employed to make the analysis is a social intelligence platform for cryptocurrencies called LunarCrush. They provide ‘Galaxy scores’ for every cryptocurrency, based on various metrics collated against other coins. 
  The Galaxy score is a good indicator to where the token stands in comparison to most tokens. $Qrdo is given a score of 70/100, faring better than most alt-coins. They also provide a rank among the prevailing alt-coins, where Qrdo is ranked at an impressive 16th of 3585 coins. 

Using Coincodex, a machine learning and AI price indicator for cryptocurrencies, we observe a bearish price sentiment and fear and greed index. However, the platform forecasts now as a good time to invest in $QRDO. 
 By analyzing the price charts we come to observe a similar trend followed by $QRDO.

It is evident that $Qrdo follows a recurring  A-B-C structure towards the downside. Using this we can devise an investment trajectory that helps us attain all DCA targets. 

### Social Media
 Qredo is active on multiple networks:

• Twitter: 79k followers as of December 2023

• Telegram (20k)

• Discord (6k)

 Qredo does a good job of keeping the users up-to-date on the operations, plans and goals by publishing quality content across their social media platforms. It’s discord community is vibrant and the team is very active.

### Risks 
**External**

●	Use of centralized services: Their nodes are residing in Equinix data centers. The protocol uses AWS databases to store. Equinix and AWS are centralized entities.

●	Regulatory risks: There may be regulatory headwinds due to Qredo probably qualifying as a VASP. Perhaps institutional clients might hesitate to try Qredo at the early stages due to this type of regulatory overhang. Conversely, the institutional investors would still want to deal with a regulated custodian platform. If required, obtaining regulatory approval may be a daunting task. There is an argument that custodians utilizing MPC might not need regulatory licensing since they never take full custody of assets.

●	Third-party reliance: Qredo relies on the Ethereum blockchain for their ERC-20 token implementation and the smart contracts for governance and treasury. Their communications layer is based on Matrix, an open-source project.

●	Market Perception: MPC might need the test of time. As discussed in this article, there could be areas of concern as this novel technology evolves in the future.

**Internal**

●	Entry barriers: It is unclear whether anyone planning to become a validator should bring in specific HSMs and whether the validators alternatively run inside Equinix data centers. This path clarification is essential for future validators
